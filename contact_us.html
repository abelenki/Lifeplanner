      <h3>About us:</h3>

      <p>  
        It was the summer of 2011 when an elite team of young masterminds were assembled for one task, and one task alone. That task was the Life Planner. They were given a mere three days to organize the lives of college students for decades and decades to come. In future years they would be dubbed revolutionary, as their web app improved; adding features to help students keep track of their eating habits, edit their Google calendars, and manage their flashcards. But despite huge success and constant harassment by the paparazzi, these three young Einsteins managed to remain the most modest people to have ever walked the Earth.

              Cassandra comes from the mythical land of Canada, where she is pursuing a degree in Interactive Art and Technology from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Cassie likes galavanting across the tundra, hunting caribou and Canada Geese. She is having difficulty adjusting to American English compared to its Canadian counterpart, especially the fact that no one says washroom or sorry, only sarry.
